# @cybervinci-ai/sdk-next

Effect-native scoped CYBERVINCI host for in-process applications. This transitional package will replace the existing generated `@cybervinci-ai/sdk` after its consumers migrate.

The SDK executes Server's assembled HTTP router in memory. It opens no listener and performs no network I/O, while preserving the same routing, middleware, handlers, codecs, and errors as the network client.

```ts
import { CYBERVINCI } from "@cybervinci-ai/sdk-next"

const cybervinci = yield * CYBERVINCI.create()
const session = yield * cybervinci.sessions.get({ sessionID })
```

It also exports `Tool` and exposes local-only `tools.register(...)`, replacing the former `@cybervinci-ai/core/public` facade. Registration uses Core's host-level `ApplicationTools` service shared by the host's Locations; each Location retains its own `ToolRegistry` for overlay, lookup, and settlement. Closing the owning Effect Scope releases router resources, location services, fibers, and scoped tool registrations.

`sessions.events({ sessionID, after })` replays durable events after the optional aggregate sequence, then emits newly committed durable events. `sessions.interrupt(...)` targets execution owned by this host, and `sessions.message(...)` retrieves one projected Session message.

The same constructor is available as a service Layer:

```ts
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const cybervinci = yield* CYBERVINCI.Service
  return yield* cybervinci.sessions.get({ sessionID })
})

yield * program.pipe(Effect.provide(CYBERVINCI.layer))
```

`CYBERVINCI.layer` adapts `CYBERVINCI.create()` for dependency injection; it does not define another host implementation.
